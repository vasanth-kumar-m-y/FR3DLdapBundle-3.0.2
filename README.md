FR3DLdapBundle
==============

The FR3DLdapBundle adds support for provide and/or authenticate users with a
LDAP Directory in Symfony2.

It's mainly developed thinking in unmanned corporate LDAP directories so you
could retrieve users from LDAP and manage them using `FOSUserBundle` features
(role management, guess users registration, etc).

Features include:

**Features included:**

- Works with [FOSUserBundle](https://github.com/FriendsOfSymfony/FOSUserBundle/)
